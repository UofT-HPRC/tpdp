Whenever I make a new Vivado project, I will also create a new directory
for compiled bitstreams. 

Usually, I also need to manage the generation of .bin files, since I 
often work with MPSoCs. By simply copying this script into the 
bitstreams directory, all I have to do is copy the .bit and .ltx from 
the runs/impl_1 directory and run the script.

You don't even have to write a .bif file!
