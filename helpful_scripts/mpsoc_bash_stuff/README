At the moment I have a bunch of different stuff dumped here. To just get up and
running, pick one of the aliases files (obviously I think my own is the best, 
but you're better off using clarks_aliases) and put it in /root/.bash_aliases

If using Camilo's aliases, put disablePci.sh into /root/disablePci.sh

Why do I have three different choices for the aliases file?

-> camilos_aliases are the ones I have been using successfully for the past few
   weeks
   
-> clarks_aliases are the ones that Clark has most recently distribyted, but 
   that I haven't used yet
   
-> marcos_aliases is my ongoing attempt to make a "final" aliases file, but I 
   can't guarantee it works 100% of the time


UPDATE:

There's this very annoying problem on the MPSoCs where accessing memory in the 
FPGA could hang the board. This is because the AXI transaction may go 
unanswered if one of your IP cores has a bug, or if there is simply no IP 
listening at your particular address.

If you run enableATB.sh as root, it will enable the ARM's AXI Timeout Blocks, 
which will prevent this type of problem from hanging your board (which, to fix, 
normally requires you to walk to the server room and press the reset button).
