At the moment I have a bunch of different stuff dumped here. To just get up and
running, pick one of the aliases files (obviously I think my own is the best, 
but you're better off using clarks_aliases) and put it in /root/.bash_aliases

If using Camilo's aliases, put disablePci.sh into /root/disablePci.sh

Why do I have three different choices for the aliases file?

-> camilos_aliases are the ones I have been using successfully for the past few
   weeks
   
-> clarks_aliases are the ones that Clark has most recently distribyted, but 
   that I haven't used yet
   
-> marcos_aliases is my ongoing attempt to make a "final" aliases file, but I 
   can't guarantee it works 100% of the time
