Let's face it: I suck at HLS. The real pros are Camilo and Clark; I can't even 
hold a candle to them.

Update, May 26 / 2020: Camilo wrote a really great tutorial for HLS, which 
you can see in hls_startup_tutorial.txt. Definitely go take a look!

However, there are a few easy things I know how to do in HLS which are really 
useful. I'll try to keep track of them here
