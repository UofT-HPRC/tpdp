ModelSim uses CMC Mentor license servers, using two ports
for flexlm (6056, 7056) and three corresponding
vendor-daemon ports (16056, 17056).

Tier-1 computers: Access to these ports is freely open
from any Tier-1 or Tier-2 computer for users who
- have CMC accounts, and
- whose supervisors subscribe to CMC services at the Designer or Prototyping
  levels, and
- who have run CADactivate on the computer where they plan to run the
  software, to connect their login name with their CMC accounts.
  (See <http://www.vrg.utoronto.ca/~jaro/VRG/licenses/CMC_subscriptions.txt>
   for CADactivate details.)

Set up your environment variable "MGLS_LICENSE_FILE" as follows:

- For csh:
   	setenv MGLS_LICENSE_FILE 7056@cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:6056@cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca
- For sh/bash:
	export MGLS_LICENSE_FILE=7056@cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:6056@cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca
- For Windows:
	MGLS_LICENSE_FILE=7056@cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca;6056@cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca
	[Note the ';' for Windows instead of ':' used on solaris/linux machines]


For access from outside ECE's Tier-1 networks, you will
need a login account on one of the Tier-1 ECE servers.  Once that is
established, you can set up SSH tunnels to access the ports
on cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca.  (You will also need to tunnel the
"vendor daemon ports", 17056, and 16056.)

You can try this:

$ ssh -f -L 7056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:7056 \
    -L 6056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:6056 \
    -L 17056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:17056 \
    -L 16056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:16056 \
    yourlogin@tier1server.group.utoronto.ca sleep 100000000
$ export MGLS_LICENSE_FILE=7056@localhost:6056@localhost


What you need before starting:
1. An account on a U of T Tier-1 Machine (eg. UG machines, or Seth)
2. An account on an Agent, **with the same username as your username on the Tier-1 Machine**
	- Eg. if your account is <utorid>@ugXXX.eecg.toronto.edu, you need an account called <utorid> on the Agent.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Follow the instructions in http://www.vrg.utoronto.ca/~jaro/VRG/licenses/CMC_subscription.txt under "Grad Students and Researchers" to make yourself a CMC account, add Paul Chow as your supervisor, and source the CMC script to associate your CMC account with your Tier-1 account.
	- Paul Chow has to approve being your supervisor on the CMC site, so please give him a heads up.
	- To source the CMC script, run `source /CMC/apps/cadactivate/cadactivate.csh`
2. On your Agent, open your .bashrc file and add the following lines:
	- ```
	  export MODELSIM_PATH=/mnt/shares/tools/modelsim/modelsim.10.7c
	  export PATH=$MODELSIM_PATH/modeltech/bin:$PATH
	  export MGLS_LICENSE_FILE=7056@localhost:6056@localhost
	  alias modelsim_license='ssh -f -L 7056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:7056 -L 6056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:6056 -L 17056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:17056 -L 16056:cadpserver.ece.utoronto.ca:16056 <username>@<tier1machine>.utoronto.ca sleep 100000000'
          alias vsim=$MODELSIM_PATH/modeltech/linux_x86_64/vsim
	  ```
	- Replace <username>@<tier1machine> with your account on the Tier-1 Machine (eg. <utorid>@ugXXX.eecg.toronto.edu).
3. Whenever you want to run modelsim, run the command `modelsim_license` in a terminal.
	- This opens up a licensing tunnel from your Tier 1 machine to your Agent. The license is associated with a specific username, which is why your usernames on the Agent and Tier-1 Machine must match
4. Run modelsim by running the command `vsim` in a terminal.
	- NOTE: If you wish to run in GUI mode, you will need to have a VNC Session running.
