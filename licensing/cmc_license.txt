=== NEW May 2022  - start ===

The CADactivate procedure has changed, as shown under "Grad students
and researchers.

=== NEW May 2022  - end ===

Prior to the summer of 2012, licenses for CAD tools from
Cadence, Synopsys and Mentor were hosted on local VRG computers,
with annual renewals occurring around May.  In the summer of
2012, these licenses began to be hosted on CMC Microsystems
computers in Kingston and Edmonton.

Only people registered at CMC Microsystems will be permitted to
access those licenses.

==========================
Professors need to ensure:
==========================
- that they have a login account at CMC Microsystems:
  - visit <http://www.cmc.ca/> and click the "Get an Account"
    button at the top right corner of the page
- that they are subscribed to CMC Microsystems 
	<http://www.cmc.ca/en/WhatWeOffer/Subscription.aspx>

==============================
Grad students and researchers:
==============================
- grad students (and any other researchers) must have accounts
  registered at CMC, too, claiming a faculty supervisor
  - visit <http://www.cmc.ca/> and click the "Get an Account"
    button at the top right corner of the page
  - **please** use a UofT e-mail address when registering; it makes
    things much easier to trace if you ever have problems with
    CAD tool licenses in the future
  - Once registered, make sure to complete *all* fields located in
    My_Account->My_Account_Details, especially your faculty
    supervisor, in order to gain access to the license.
  - you should receive email notification from CMC when your supervisor
    acknowledges supervising you; at that time your registration is
    complete.  CMC updates their license access files several times
    per day during business hours -- I think 9am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm --
    so there could be some delay before you can actually access licenses.
- upon completion of the registration processing, all users
  must run an activation script to associate their UofT credentials
  to their CMC account:
	- from a linux machine, type
		/CMC/apps/cadactivate/cadactivate.csh
  Type your CMC username (normally your email address) and password.

  NOTE: The activation must be run from a
	computer where your username is identical to the
	username you will use while trying to acquire licenses.

===================
Course instructors:
===================
For course-work: ECE has an Institutional Subscription, which
means that licenses for ECE course-work are included for no
additional cost.
To set up license access for a course, please send a
message to "licensing@cmc.ca" -- with a 'cc' to
jaro.pristupa@utoronto.ca -- with details of 
- instructor's name
- course number
- course name
- the list of CAD tools required (normally "Cadence, Synopsys, and Mentor"
  will be sufficient for courses related to electronics or computers)
  Other tools (e.g. Keysight ADS) are also available; you can check on
  CMC's website for availability.
- estimated number of students, or (better) a list of the UtorIDs
  of the students in your course.  You can download such a list from
  Quercus.  Please also include the UtorIDs of any TAs who might also
  need to access the CAD tools, and your own UtorID if you plan to
  test as well.

CMC will send you a course-ID and password that you can *ignore*.
(If you send the list of UtorIDs, CMC staff can activate those logins automatically
for you once the course is registered, even before the term begins,
and the course-ID/password can be discarded.)
Once the term begins, you or your TA can communicate with CMC to add
UtorIDs for students who register late.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
