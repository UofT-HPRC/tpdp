Start out taking a quick look at idioms.txt. This is a short list of common 
design patterns used in the linux kernel, and I find that knowing them makes it
a lot easier to read kernel source code. Anyway, if you ever need to do any
kernel programming (such as making a driver) it usually boils down to getting 
the main skeleton in place, copying some code from elsewhere in the kernel, and
modifying it for your particular use case.

By the way, one of the easiest ways to browse kernel source code is to go to
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source
I browse kernel sources on the regular, because often it's the only way to get
an answer to specific questions.

driver_basics.txt is just meant to tell you the general "flow" of developing a
simple Linux driver. Of course, driver-writing is quite challenging, and I've
put all my knowledge of more complicated topics into separate files. 

Well, those are the only files for now. Documentation, as always, is a work in
progress!
