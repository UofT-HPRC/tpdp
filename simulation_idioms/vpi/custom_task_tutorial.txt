OVERVIEW
========

You know how you can call system tasks like $fscanf, $display, $readmemh, etc. 
from inside Verilog? Well it turns out you can write your own system tasks in C 
that do whatever you want.

To do this, you will use the Verilog Programming Interface (VPI). By writing 
certain functions with certain arguments, you can compile a shared object that 
any (compliant) Verilog simulator will know how to load at runtime.

The steps to using VPI are as follows; each one is explained in detail in a 
later section.

    In your C source code,
    
    1) Create a NULL-terminated array of function pointers that will be called 
       when the Verilog simulator loads your shared object. 
       
    2) In one (or more) of your startup routines, call vpi_register_systf for 
       each new system task you want to add. This function takes a struct as 
       its argument which includes (among other things) two callbacks:
       
        2a) A "compiletf" callback. When the Verilog file is initially parsed 
            by the Verilog simulator, this callback is triggered to let you 
            check arguments to your system tasks. This callback is optional and 
            can be omitted.
            
        2b) A "calltf" callback. Whereas the compiletf callback is a static 
            compiletime check, this callback actually implements the system 
            function (at runtime) that you are asking for in your Verilog code.
    
    And finally,
    
    3) Compile the C and Verilog and run the Verilog simulator with the correct
       arguments.

This document starts with a minimal working example that you should be able to 
start using right away. The rest of the document explains the steps in detail:

    - Registering your callbacks
    - The VPI API that your callbacks will use
    - How to write the callbacks themselves

It's not as hard as it looks, I promise!

MINIMAL WORKING EXAMPLE
=======================

This example has two source files (and a Makefile). my_task.c contains the code 
that will be called by the Verilog simulation, and hello.v is the Verilog file 
that calls it.

Please note: the provided Makefile uses Icarus Verilog. You can install it from 
the iverilog package. You can use XSim or Modelsim instead of Icarus, but 
you'll have to figure out how to write the Makefile to support them.

my_task.c
~~~~~~~~~

    #include  <vpi_user.h>

    static int my_compiletf(char*user_data) {
          return 0;
    }

    static int my_calltf(char* user_data) {
          vpi_printf("Hello, World!\n");
          return 0;
    }

    void my_task_register() {
        s_vpi_systf_data tf_data = {
            .type      = vpiSysTask,
            .tfname    = "$my_task",
            .calltf    = my_calltf,
            .compiletf = my_compiletf,
            .user_data = 0
        };
        
        vpi_register_systf(&tf_data);
    }

    void (*vlog_startup_routines[])() = {
        my_task_register,
        NULL
    };


hello.v
~~~~~~~

    module main;
    initial $my_task();
    endmodule


Makefile
~~~~~~~~

    all: hello.vvp

    my_task.o: my_task.c
        gcc -c -fpic -fno-diagnostics-show-caret my_task.c -I/usr/include/iverilog 
        
    my_task.vpi: my_task.o
        gcc -shared -o my_task.vpi my_task.o -lvpi

    hello.vvp:	hello.v
        iverilog -o hello.vvp hello.v

    run: hello.vvp my_task.vpi
        vvp -M. -mmy_task hello.vvp

        rm -rf *.vpi
        rm -rf *.vvp


==========================================
STARTUP ROUTINES AND REGISTERING CALLBACKS
==========================================

In general, the VPI works by allowing you to register callbacks. You can 
register callbacks for:

    - Simulation events, such value changes or behavioural statement execution
    - Simulation time, such as at a certain time in the simulation
    - Global simulator events, such as startup, end of compile, etc.
    - User-defined system tasks/functions

For this tutorial, we will only do the custom tasks. Check out general_vpi.txt 
for more information on the other callbacks.

This section explains how to register callbacks with the VPI. Writing the 
custom task callbacks themselves is a little involved, so this in described in 
the next section ("Writing System Task Callbacks").

STARTUP ROUTINES
----------------

When the Verilog runtime loads your (compiled) C code, it will look for the 
following variable:

    void (*vlog_startup_routines[])() = {
        fn1,
        fn2,
        ...,
        NULL
    };

This variable has type "array of pointers to functions taking no arguments and 
returning void" and must be named "vlog_startup_routines". The array must be 
NULL-terminated.

These functions can be whatever you want, but usually they are used to register 
new system tasks, which we discuss in the next subsection.

(See example at end of this section)


REGISTERING A SYSTEM TASK
-------------------------

To register a callback for custom system tasks you need to call a specific VPI 
function (described below) from inside one of the functions in your 
vlog_startup_routines array.


vpiHandle vpi_register_systf(s_vpi_systf_data *my_data) {
          ******************
    INFO: 
        Returns a vpiHandle to the callback. vpiHandles are explained in the 
        "Writing System Task Callbacks" section, below. 

    my_data: 
        A pointer to an s_vpi_systf_data struct. This struct has the following 
        members:
            int32 type: Can be either vpiSysTask or vpiSysFunction. Says 
            whether this is a task or a function; this tutorial only covers 
            tasks. See general_vpi.txt for more info.
               
            int32 sysfunctype: Denotes return type if this is a custom function 
            (as opposed to a task). For this tutorial, we won't use this.

            char *tfname: The name of your system task. It must start with '$' 
            and consist only of [a-zA-Z0-9_S] characters.

            int32 (*calltf)(char*):
            int32 (*compiletf)(char*): These are the callbacks. See the next 
            section for information on how to write these.

            int32 (*sizetf)(char*): This callback is only used with functions. 
            We don't use this.

            char *user_data: This pointer is passed as the argument to your 
            callback functions. See the next subsection for more details.
}


Example: (mostly taken from the "Minimal Working Example" section)

    //adapted from https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Using_VPI
    
    #include <vpi_user.h> //Add -I/usr/include/iverilog and -lvpi to gcc
    
    //It is strongly recommended that you use static to avoid name collisions!
    static int my_compiletf(char*user_data);
    static int my_calltf(char* user_data);
    
    void my_startup_routine() {
        s_vpi_systf_data tf_data = {
            .type      = vpiSysTask,
            .tfname    = "$my_task",
            .calltf    = my_calltf,
            .compiletf = my_compiletf,
            .user_data = 0
        };
        
        vpi_register_systf(&tf_data);
    }

    void (*vlog_startup_routines[])() = {
        my_startup_routine,
        NULL
    };


=======
VPI API
=======

Before we can write system task callbacks, we need to understand the API that 
VPI expects you to use. It's actually quite simple; don't be fooled the length 
of this section. I've put some examples at the end of this section; I recommend 
reading back and forth between the examples and the text.

RATIONALE
---------

In a running Verilog simulation, there are a bunch of objects in memory 
representing things such as modules, nets, expressions, as well as custom 
tasks, among many other things. Each of these objects keeps links to other 
objects in addition to their own values/properties (such as name strings).

All objects are referred to using vpiHandles, which are basically void 
pointers. As would be expected, a vpiHandle with a value of 0 is invalid 
(a.k.a. a NULL pointer).

Given a vpiHandle to an object, you can do one of two things: 1) follow one of 
the object's pointers to another object, or 2) access one of the object's 
values. The functions for doing these are described in the followin 
subsections.


GRAPH TRAVERSAL FUNCTIONS (vpi_handle, vpi_iterate, and vpi_scan)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                   
vpiHandle vpi_handle(int32 type, vpiHandle obj) {
          **********
    INFO:
        Given a handle to an object that contains handles to other objects, 
        fetch the handle that corresponds to the correct type. This only works 
        if the object has exactly one "child" of that type. 
        
        For example, a net object has only one handle to a module object (i.e. 
        the module that contains the wire). In this example, given h_net, you 
        could get the module by doing
        
        vpiHandle module_h = vpi_handle(vpiModule, net_h);
        
        If your object has multiple handles to objects of a specific type, you 
        need to use vpi_iterate and vpi_scan.
        
    type:
        One of the constants defined in vpi_user.h. This list includes: 
        vpiConstant, vpiFunction, vpiIntegerVar, vpiIterator, vpiMemory, 
        vpiMemoryWord, vpiModPath, vpiModule, vpiNamedBegin, vpiNamedEvent, 
        vpiNamedFork, vpiNet, vpiParameter, vpiPartSelect, vpiPathTerm, 
        vpiPort, vpiRealVar, vpiReg, vpiSysFuncCall, vpiSysTaskCall, vpiTask, 
        vpiTimeVar, vpiUdpDefn, vpiUserSystf, vpiNetArray, vpiIndex, 
        vpiLeftRange, vpiParent, vpiRightRange, vpiScope, vpiSysTfCall, 
        vpiArgument, vpiInternalScope, vpiModPathIn, vpiModPathOut, 
        vpiVariables, and vpiExpr. This is not a complete list.
    
    obj: 
        A handle to an object.
}


vpiHandle vpi_iterate(int32 type, vpiHandle obj) {
          ***********
    INFO:
        Does the same thing as vpi_handle, except it returns a handle to a 
        vpiIterator object. You must use this function if the object in 
        question has multiple links to objects of the desired type.
        
        The vpiIterator object is "dereferenced and incremented" using 
        vpi_scan. An example is given at the end of this subsection.
    
    type:
    obj:
        Same as in vpi_handle.
}


vpiHandle vpi_scan(vpiHandle iter) {
          ********
    INFO:
        Call this function on a vpiHandle to a vpiIterator object. It will 
        "dereference" the iterator and return a handle to the object it points 
        to. It will also "increment" the iterator so that it points to the next 
        object in the list (the idea is to call vpi_scan repeatedly on the same 
        vpiIterator).
        
        This function returns 0 (a.k.a. a NULL pointer) when the end of the 
        list is reached. The iterator object will be freed and is can no 
        longer be used.
        
        If you do not traverse the whole list, you must call
        
            vpi_free_object(iter);
            
        to free the iterator object. Otherwise, you will be leaking memory.

    iter:
        A vpiHandle to a vpiIterator (as obtained from the vpi_iterate 
        function).
}


PROPERTY ACCESS FUNCTIONS (vpi_get and vpi_get_str)
---------------------------------------------------
                  
int32 vpi_get(int32 prop, vpiHandle obj) {
      *******
    INFO:
        
}


char* vpi_get_str(int32 prop, vpiHandle obj) {
      ***********
    INFO:
        
}


RECAP
-----

If you're looking for a reference of all the different types of objects and 
their properties, see Section 26.6 in the IEEE 1364-2005 standard. 


EXAMPLES
--------

Example 1: (adapted from IEEE Standard 1364-2005, Section 27.21)

    //The argument is a vpiHandle to a vpiModule object
    void display_nets(vpiHandle mod) {
        //Uses the vpi_get_str function to access a string property
        vpi_printf(
            "Nets declared in module %s\n",
            vpi_get_str(vpiFullName, mod)
        );
        
        //Forward-declare handles
        vpiHandle net;
        vpiHandle itr;
        
        //Get an iterator for all the nets in the modules
        itr = vpi_iterate(vpiNet, mod);
        
        //Use vpi_scan to visit each net
        while (net = vpi_scan(itr)) {
            vpi_printf("\t%s", vpi_get_str(vpiName, net));
            
            //This tries to get the "vpiVector" property from the vpiNet object. 
            //If the net is a vector, the vpiVector value is nonzero. Otherwise,
            //if the net is a single wire, the value is 0. 
            if (vpi_get(vpiVector, net)) {
                vpi_printf(" of size %d\n", vpi_get(vpiSize, net));
            } else {
                vpi_printf("\n");
            }
        }
    }

Example 2: (adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog_Procedural_Interface)

    //Implements a calltf system task for incrementing a variable
    static int increment(char *userdata) {
        vpiHandle systfref, args_iter, argh;
        struct t_vpi_value argval;
        int value;

        // Obtain a handle to the argument list
        systfref = vpi_handle(vpiSysTfCall, NULL);
        args_iter = vpi_iterate(vpiArgument, systfref);

        // Grab the value of the first argument
        argh = vpi_scan(args_iter);
        argval.format = vpiIntVal;
        vpi_get_value(argh, &argval);
        value = argval.value.integer;
        vpi_printf("VPI routine received %d\n", value);

        // Increment the value and put it back as first argument
        argval.value.integer = value + 1;
        vpi_put_value(argh, &argval, NULL, vpiNoDelay);

        // Cleanup and return
        vpi_free_object(args_iter);
        return 0;
    }
