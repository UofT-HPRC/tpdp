How Marco likes to write testbenches:

First, I will make a .mem file which has my test inputs. This is pretty easy to 
make manually, but you could easily write a little program to generate it.

In this folder is an example of a simulation I wrote for one of my projects.
Essentially, in the testbench file, I use:

	fd = $fopen("axistream_forwarder_drivers.mem", "r");
	while($fgetc(fd) != "\n") begin end //Skip first line of comments

to open the .mem file and skip the first line (which I use for comments). Then,
you can write:


	reg ready_for_forwarder;
	reg TREADY;
	always @(posedge clk) begin
		if ($feof(fd)) begin
			$display("Reached end of drivers file");
			$finish;
		end
		$fscanf(fd, "%b%b", ready_for_forwarder, TREADY);
	end


to set your inputs just as you wrote them in your .mem file.

I provided the entire testbench as a reference, but note that there is some 
extra stuff in there you probably don't care about.
