This is something Camilo showed me the other day. I couldn't bvelieve I didn't
know about it!

Basically, I thought a simulation always required a testbench. Not so!

You can simply run a behavioural simulation with your design set as the 
top-level module (i.e. no testbench required). Then, right-click on all your 
inputs (which will show as all Zs in the waveform) and just use the "force 
clock" and "force value" functions. 

Once you've set everything you want to set, manually step time forward (10 ns 
is usually a good amount). Anytime you want to change the values, simply repeat 
the forcing process before stepping time again.

It's a little clunky, but it's a really fast way to test designs, especially 
single-function HLS cores!
