This folder explains the PS-PL communcation libraries written by Clark and 
Camilo. For posterity, the library source has been copied here, in the include/ 
and util/ folders. The text files are meant to explain the API. 

IMPORTANT: The features in this library depend on certain kernel modules to be 
installed. This should already be done on the MPSoCs, but here's a reference of 
which ones you need:
  - mpsoc_axiregs.ko (see mpsoc_programming/drivers)
  - mpsoc_PSRegs.ko (see mpsoc_programming/drivers)
  - axidma.ko (from https://github.com/bperez77/xilinx_axidma)
  - Xilinx DMAEngine driver (should already be compiled into kernel)


If all you want to do is shuffle a few bytes around in registers, the API is 
described in simple_register_accesses.txt and is fairly simple.

If you want to do something more complicated (such as reading/writing to an AXI 
Stream interface or performing DMA transfers) check out stream_and_dma.txt. 
It's a little more involved, but not overly complicated.
