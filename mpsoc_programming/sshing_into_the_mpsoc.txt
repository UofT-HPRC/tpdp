If you are somehow already on the 10.10.14.X subnet, then simply perform:

    $ ssh savi@10.10.14.20X

where X is the MPSoC number. For example, to SSH into MPSoC 15, you would use 
10.10.14.215.



If you are connecting from elsewhere on the internet, perform:

    $ ssh -p 234YY savi@142.150.179.130

where YY is the MPSoC number. For MPSoC 15, this would be 23415.

For extra safety, I will not put the password in this repo. Please contact 
someone in person and we will give it to you.
