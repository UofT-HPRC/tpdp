These are two really simple programs to manually read/write registers in the 
FPGA. They're also really handy to put in a shell script.

Basically, 

    $ poke 0xA0001000

will print out whatever is at the 32 bit word at 0xA0001000.

    $ poke 0xA0001000 1010

will write the HEX VALUE 0x1010 (=4112) to 0xA0001000.


Finally,

    $dpoke 0xA0001000 1010

will write the DECIMAL VALUE one-thousand-and-ten to 0xA0001000.




These programs use the mpsoc_axiregs driver, which was written by Clark. The 
source code is provided in mpsoc_programming/drivers/mpsoc_axiregs
