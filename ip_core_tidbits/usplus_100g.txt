If you've ever tried using 100G on the MPSoCs, you would have used a
"usplus_ethernet_subsystem" IP core. From now on, I will call this the
100G core. 

The 100G core is actually simpler than you'd expect, but it is still 
not easy to configure correctly. Over time I want to provide brief 
explanations for the most important parameters, but first let's start 
by putting up some reasonable parameters that should just get you 
started:

===================
BASIC CONFIGURATION
===================

First of all, don't use the interfaces from the board file (in the board
pins tab, leave everything to custom). Sometimes it works, but I find it
just causes me headaches down the line.

 ->Â You will not be able to export your block design as a TCL and rebuild
    it in another project
 -> On occasion, sometimes it will say "you can't set the CMAC core to 
    X0Y2", even though you really probably should be able to. This error
    will not go away until you delete the IP and put it back, which will
    make you redo the other parts of the configuration and rewire your 
    stuff.
