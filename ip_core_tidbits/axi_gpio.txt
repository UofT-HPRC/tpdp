The AXI GPIO block is not very difficult to use, and the product guide will be 
able to explain how to use it.

There is one problem that I ran into though, based on a specific use case for 
AXI GPIOs: setting configuration inputs for a core.

You see, it's a real pain in the ass to make an AXI Lite config bus for a 
Verilog core. Oh yes, it can be done using AirHDL, but it's a lot of extra 
effort. Wouldn't it be nice to just use a GPIO block?

Well, it is a lot nicer, but you have to set false paths on the inputs to your 
core. I like to use Vivado's "Edit timing constraints" GUI. Use "double-click 
to create new false path constraint...". Don't put anything in "from" or "to", 
and just put the input pins to your core in "through". I do this by searching 
for the right PARENT_CELL and checkign for DIRECTION=IN. Make sure "Cell pins" 
is selected in the dropdown at the top.


Anwyay, I know that's not a great description, but I'm busy with other things 
today and I just wanted to write a quick blurb before I forgot. Send me a 
message if you need more info.
