MPSoC does not have login prompt on serial
	Sometimes, if your SSH is not working, you need a command line on an 
	MPSoC. The easiest way to do this is plug in the JTAG cable and use 
	
		sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0
		
	on the computer you connected it to.
	
	Problem is, sometimes that login prompt will not show up. At boot, it 
	will say something like "starting a run job of getty..." and eventually 
	time out.
	
	The solution is to remove the SD card, open up the files in another 
	computer, go into /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants and copy the 
	getty@tty1.service into getty@ttyPS0.service.

MPSoC SSH does not start at boot
	This happened to us after upgrading some packages. Essentially, there 
	is a bug with a certain version of systemd where installing the package 
	will change the owner of / (i.e. the root directory). Simply log on to 
	the system (through the serial console) and type
	
		sudo chown root: /
	
	and that should fix the problem
