AXI interconnect hangs the ARM when only using debug bridge:
	In some projects the PS is only there to hook up an XVC server to 
	something. In these cases (and ONLY in these cases) you should use an 
	AXI Smart Connect IP to connect the PS to the debug bridge. If you use 
	an AXI interconnect, it will hang the board. Even if you take into 
	account Camilo's tip about having two masters at minimum.

Debug bridge hangs Linux
	The debug bridge can run at 100 MHz, but not at 200 MHz. I'm not sure 
	what the maximum clock speed is.
