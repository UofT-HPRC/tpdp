GULF Stream is not ready when you expect it to be:
    This occurs when GULF Stream was not able to perform an ARP. Anytime this 
    happens, it is 100% your fault. I have _never_, I repeat, _never_ found a 
    problem with GULF Stream itself!
    
    The first thing to check in this case is your IP addresses, especially to 
    make sure there are no conflicts. Barring that, also make sure there are no 
    MAC address conflicts.

100G subsystem expects "dense" LBUS signals:
	The 100G ethernet subsystem assumes that your LBUS input is continuous. 
	If you use Clark's AXIS to LBUS converter, this means you have to use a 
	packet mode fifo on the AXIS input to the converter. Otherwise, if your 
	TVALID signal goes low in the middle of a packet, the 100G core will 
	output a packet with a bad frame check sequence.
	
	[NOTE: please see the note about packet mode FIFOs in other_axi_trouble]
