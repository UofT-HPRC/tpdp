100G subsystem expects "dense" LBUS signals:
	The 100G ethernet subsystem assumes that your LBUS input is continuous. 
	If you use Clark's AXIS to LBUS converter, this means you have to use a 
	packet mode fifo on the AXIS input to the converter. Otherwise, if your 
	TVALID signal goes low in the middle of a packet, the 100G core will 
	output a packet with a bad frame check sequence.
	
	[NOTE: please see the note about packet mode FIFOs in other_axi_trouble]
