Undocumented Maximum AXI Clock From PS
    We have found that 250 MHz doesn't work, even though Vivado claims it 
    passes timing. Basically, once in a while a value will be mangled. At 
    200 MHz everything is okay.

My MPSoC hangs whenever I try to access the PL!
    This happens when an AXI transaction doesn't get a response from the PL. In 
    this case, the PS will wait forever for a transaction that will be 
    answered. I do have a workaround for this: copy 
    helpful_scripts/mpsoc_bash_stuff/enableATB.sh to your MPSoC and run it as 
    root. It requires the devmem2 program, which is easily installed via
    
        sudo apt-get install devmem2
    
    (The devmem2 program is generally useful, so you may want it anyway)

Cache coherence when dealing with PS:
    It turns out that the "C" in some of the slave AXI full interfaces on the 
    PS stands for "Coherent". For example, "S_AXI_HP0_FPD" does NOT enforce 
    cache coherency, but "S_AXI_HPC0_FPD" does. This really matter a lot when 
    you're dealing with the AXI DMA.

AXIS Data FIFOs do not have correct packet mode when two clocks are used:
	Title says it all. Instead of one FIFO in packet mode with two clocks, 
	instead use one small two-clock FIFO for the clock crossing, then plug 
	that into a single-domain packet mode FIFO.
