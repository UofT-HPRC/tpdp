AXI DMA reading form wrong address on SG bus
    The AXI DMA can only do 128-bytes aligned reads on its SG bus. It's this 
    tiny little paragraph in one of the tables in the product guide... do you 
    know how many hours I lost to that??
        
        "Descriptors must be 16 word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80 and 
        others. Any other alignment has undefined results."

Help! My AXI DMA is reading garbage on its SG bus!
    I do not know why this happens. For reference, here are the settings I was 
    using when it first started working for me:
    
    The AXI DMA's SG and S2MM AXI Masters were wired into an AXI interconnect. 
    This interconnect's master output was wired into the S_AXI_HPC0_FPD slave 
    on the Zynq. The S_AXI_HPC0_FPD slave had width 128.
    
    I went into the interconnect's advanced options and forced the crossbar 
    width to be 128. After validating design, I made sure there was no 
    datawidth converter on the coupler between the crossbar and the PS.
    
    One last thing: I don't know if this is necesary, but I found this tip on 
    the internet: expand the AXI slaves on the interconnect. Wire a constant 
    1011 into ARCACHE and AWCACHE. This will override the values coming from 
    the AXI DMA (without modifying any others). It's hard to tell from the 
    documentation, but this potentially fixes cache coherency issues?
