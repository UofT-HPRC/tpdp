This is a list of things that caused me to lose (a lot of) time. Eventually, I 
will try to find a better way to organize this so that it's easier to search 
through.

Simple Dual Port BRAMs simply do not work
    No, not the inference from Verilog, and not even the BRAM_SDP_MACRO. If you 
    run synthesis and check the schematic, you will find that the read and 
    write enables; the read and write addresses; as well as the read and write 
    data are all pairwise flipped.
    
    In other words, it's a bug! It's broken! It's kaputt!

Auto-generated AXI interconnects are correct about 50% of the time
	It's true! Even if you run validate design (which propagates 
	parameters), AXI Interconnects can still be DEAD WRONG*. This is the 
	single biggest time-killer in my day-to-day work, since it invariably 
	results in a hung MPSoC. 
	
		*All AXI interconnects are essentially an AXI crossbar with the 
		necessary conversion logic (called "couplers") around it. I'm 
		pretty sure that validation will update the couplers, but never 
		the crossbar, which is the source of many problems.
	
	Though it may strain thy mental pathways, yea, thou must always checkst 
	thine AXI interconnects, lest thy little time on this Earth be 
	squandered.

Breaking out interface pins on a hierarchy:
	In a Vivado block design, it is possible to have interface pins on a 
	hierarchy. If, on the inside of the hierarchy, you connect the 
	interface pin to something, but on the outside, you split open the 
	hierarchy to connect individual wires, VIVADO WILL NOT CONNECT 
	ANYTHING. It won't even warn you.

AXI interconnect hangs the ARM when only using debug bridge:
	In some projects the PS is only there to hook up an XVC server to 
	something. In these cases (and ONLY in these cases) you should use an 
	AXI Smart Connect IP to connect the PS to the debug bridge. If you use 
	an AXI interconnect, it will hang the board. Even if you take into 
	account Camilo's tip about having two masters at minimum.

(Auto-generated) constraints ignored in synthesis
    For unknown reasons, sometimes Vivado will uncheck "Used in synthesis" on 
    XDC files in your IP cores. Go to the "Sources" tab, then click "IP 
    Sources" at the bottom. Search for ".xdc" to see all constraints files. 
    Sometimes, in the properties, "Used in synthesis" will be unchecked (and 
    grayed out). To check it, right-click on the XDC file in the sources list 
    and click "Set used in..."
