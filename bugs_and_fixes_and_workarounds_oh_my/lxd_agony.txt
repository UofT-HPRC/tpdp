Using apt-get installs a ridiculously old version of LXD
    For some bizarre reason, you have to use a different package manager
    to install the most recent verions: 
        https://stgraber.org/2016/10/17/lxd-snap-available/
    You really do need to do this. Many of the help docs and commands you
    find online rely on the new version.
    
    By the way, I have added
    
        alias lxc=/snap/bin/lxc
        alias lxd=/snap/bin/lxd
    
    in my .bashrc. Be careful when using sudo to always use /snap/bin/lxd
    instead of just lxd (otherwise, you will end up using the old version)


LXD fails to restart after host machine is rebooted. 
    For me, this happened because the database got corrupted. I would get 
    error messages with lxc commands that said something like "could not
    connect to unix.socket" or whatever. Another error message I got from
    the journalctl command was:
    
        May 25 13:01:40 agent-31 lxd.daemon[37308]: 
        t=2020-05-25T13:01:40-0400 lvl=eror msg="Failed to start the 
        daemon: Failed to start dqlite server: raft_start(): io: closed 
        segment 0000000000001036-0000000000001050 is past last snapshot 
        snapshot-1-1024-6590035"
    
    Basically, what I had to do was find the lxd database:
    
        $ cd /
        $ find -name "database" 2>/dev/null | less
    
    Eventually, this turned up the directory
        
        /var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/database/
    
    So the commands I ran (as root) were:
    
        $ cd /var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/
        $ tar -czf backup.tgz database       # (just in case bad things happen)
        $ rm database/global/0000*
        $ systemctl restart snap.lxd.daemon
