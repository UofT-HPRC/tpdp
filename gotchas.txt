This is a list of things that caused me to lose (a lot of) time. Eventually, I 
will try to find a better way to organize this so that it's easier to search 
through.

Breaking out interface pins on a hierarchy:
	In a Vivado block design, it is possible to have interface pins on a 
	hierarchy. If, on the inside of the hierarchy, you connect the 
	interface pin to something, but on the outside, you split open the 
	hierarchy to connect individual wires, VIVADO WILL NOT CONNECT 
	ANYTHING. It won't even warn you.
	
	
100G subsystem expects "dense" LBUS signals:
	The 100G ethernet subsystem assumes that your LBUS input is continuous. 
	If you use Clark's AXIS to LBUS converter, this means you have to use a 
	packet mode fifo on the AXIS input to the converter. Otherwise, if your 
	TVALID signal goes low in the middle of a packet, the 100G core will 
	output a packet with a bad frame check sequence.


AXIS Data FIFOs do not have correct packet mode when two clocks are used:
	Title says it all. Instead of one FIFO in packet mode with two clocks, 
	instead use one small two-clock FIFO for the clock crossing, then plug 
	that into a single-domain packet mode FIFO.


AXI interconnect hangs the ARM when only using debug bridge:
	In some projects the PS is only there to hook up an XVC server to 
	something. In these cases (and ONLY in these cases) you should use an 
	AXI Smart Connect IP to connect the PS to the debug bridge. If you use 
	an AXI interconnect, it will hang the board. Even if you take into 
	account Camilo's tip about having two masters at minimum.
	
Debug bridge hangs Linux
	The debug bridge can run at 100 MHz, but not at 200 MHz. I'm not sure 
	what the maximum clock speed is.
