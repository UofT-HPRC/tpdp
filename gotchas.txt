This is a list of things that caused me to lose (a lot of) time. Eventually, I 
will try to find a better way to organize this so that it's easier to search 
through.

Breaking out interface pins on a hierarchy:
	In a Vivado block design, it is possible to have interface pins on a 
	hierarchy. If, on the inside of the hierarchy, you connect the 
	interface pin to something, but on the outside, you split open the 
	hierarchy to connect individual wires, VIVADO WILL NOT CONNECT 
	ANYTHING. It won't even warn you.
	
	
100G subsystem expects "dense" LBUS signals
	The 100G ethernet subsystem assumes that your LBUS input is continuous. 
	If you use Clark's AXIS to LBUS converter, this means you have to use a 
	packet mode fifo on the AXIS input to the converter. Otherwise, if your 
	TVALID signal goes low in the middle of a packet, the 100G core will 
	output a packet with a bad frame check sequence.

AXIS data FIFO packet mode does not work with two clocks
	Instead, use one small FIFO for clock crossing and then place a FIFO 
	for the packet mode buffering.
